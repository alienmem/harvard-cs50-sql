# Week 6: Scaling

## Topics Covered

- **Scalability** — Growing database capacity to meet demand
- **MySQL** — Enterprise relational database system
  - Integer types (TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT, BIGINT)
  - String types (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT variants)
  - Date/Time types (DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP)
  - DECIMAL for fixed precision
  - Floating-point imprecision
- **Stored Procedures** — Reusable SQL code blocks
- **PostgreSQL** — Advanced open-source database
  - SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT
  - SERIAL types for auto-incrementing IDs
  - Custom ENUM types
  - TIMESTAMP, DATE, TIME, INTERVAL
  - NUMERIC for precise decimals
- **Vertical Scaling** — Adding resources to single server
- **Horizontal Scaling** — Distributing across multiple servers
- **Replication** — Copying data across servers
- **Read Replicas** — Dedicated servers for read operations
- **Sharding** — Partitioning data across databases
- **Access Controls** — GRANT and REVOKE permissions
- **SQL Injection Attacks** — Security vulnerabilities
- **Prepared Statements** — Safe parameterized queries
